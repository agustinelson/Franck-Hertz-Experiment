# Franck-Hertz-Experiment
Here are included the graphs of the Franck Hertz experiment and the corresponding codes to elaborate them.

The Franck-Hertz experiment is a classic physics experiment that was conducted by James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1914. The experiment was designed to provide evidence for the existence of discrete energy levels in atoms .

In the Franck-Hertz experiment, a tube filled with low-pressure mercury vapor is placed between two electrodes. One of the electrodes is heated to a high temperature, which causes electrons to be emitted and travel towards the other electrode. The distance between the electrodes is carefully controlled so that the electrons have just enough energy to overcome the ionization energy of the mercury atoms and cause them to emit light.

As the electrons travel through the mercury vapor, they undergo collisions with the mercury atoms. These collisions transfer energy to the mercury atoms, causing them to become excited. The excited mercury atoms then emit light at discrete wavelengths, which can be observed using a spectrometer.

By measuring the voltage applied to the electrodes and the corresponding wavelengths of light emitted by the mercury atoms, Franck and Hertz were able to show that the energy of the electrons was quantized. They observed that the electrons only had enough energy to excite the mercury atoms to discrete energy levels, and that the energy of the electrons was directly proportional to the voltage applied to the electrodes.

The Franck-Hertz experiment provided strong evidence for the existence of discrete energy levels in atoms, and helped to confirm the emerging quantum mechanical model of the atom. The experiment has since been repeated with other gases and has become a classic demonstration of the wave-particle duality of matter.
